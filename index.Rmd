# Markdown

Markdown is a way to make fancy documents. 
Make sure you "Knit" often -- after every major change -- to mitigate errors. 
Hashtags are how we make section levels of a doc. 

## Next level 
### Next level 
#### Fourth level 
##### Fifth level   

# Basic formatting

This is **bold.** (that's double asterisks). Or *italics*. Or `code`. 

- this is the start of a list.  
- next item.   
- next item. make sure to have space at end of item.  

1. this is a numbered list. 
2. second item.  

To add a hyperlink, do `[link text](url)` without backticks.    
For example, [go here](https://www.sewanee.edu)

To link to sections of your document, do `[link text](#section-name)`, without backticks, with hyphens for spaces, and everything lower-cased. For example, [go here](#next-level).  

To add more vertical space between blocks of text, use this: "&nbsp;" without quotes. 
&nbsp;  

&nbsp; 

Should be more space now. 

**To include an image -- fun!** 
first put an image inside the folder where your `Rmd` file is located. 
Then type `![](full_image_filename_here){width="50%"}`

![](../images/cat.jpeg){width="50%"}
![](../images/RiverBundle.jpeg){width="50%"}

# RMarkdown 

`RMarkdown` is just `Markdown` with `R` code woven in.  

You can R stuff in the same line as text. For example, `r 3+3` will show as 6. 
(It would like backtick lower-case-r space then code then backtick).  

You can also do a full-multi-line CHUNK of R stuff:  

```{r chunk-name }
# ```{r}
3 + 3
# ```
```

Settings to control how R chunks appear: 

- `eval = TRUE`: which actually runs the code; if `FALSE`, it shows the code but doesn't run it. 
- `echo = TRUE`: which shows the code; if `FALSE`, the code can run without being seen. 
- `warnings = FALSE`: which will turn off warnings. 

- `fig.cap = "figure caption"` adds a figure caption. 

- `fig.width = 7` example of figure width. 

- `fig.height = 4` example of figure width. height? -Max


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r read data, }
library(readr)
energy <- read_csv("../data/IRENA data.csv", skip=1) 
```
```{r explore data, }
library(dplyr)
energy %>% names
energy %>% head
energy %>% tail 
energy %>% pull(Technology) %>% unique %>% sort
energy %>% pull(`Country/area`) %>% unique
```

### Filtering code now
Here is a new section where I talk about what I am doing

```{r}
# filter data
fenergy <-
  energy %>%
  filter(`Country/area` == 'United States of America (the)')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
